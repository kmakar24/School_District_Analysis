# School_District_Analysis
## Overview 
Thomas High School has found evidence that there has been academic dishonesty with their 9th graders. In this challange we use Anaconda to conduct a school district analysis to find out the full extent of the academic dishonesty among Thomas High School's 9th graders. Speciafically, their reading and math scores we looked more into. We analyzed the entire district and than removed Thomas High Schools 9th graders and than evaluate and compare the two sets of data.  
## Results
### District Summary
There was not that big of a difference.  We removed around 400-500 scores out of almost 40,000 student, thats a very small portion of the dataset so it did not have a big impact on the district summary. 
### School Summary 
Where as for removing it from the school summary had a huge impact because it was almost 1/4 of the data. Therefor, we saw a huge drop in the Overall Passing rate. 
### Replacing 9th Graders' Math and Reading Scores affect on: 
- Thomas High School's Performance Relative to the other schools

as one can see Thomas High Schools Performance compared to other schools dropped significantly, they went from #2 to being towards the bottom of the list.

 # Summary 
  1. Thomas high schools ranking significantly changed. 
  2. The biggest impact it had weas on it's own school, it really did not effect other schools or data too much. 
  3. There is no way to truly judge how Thomas high school is performing since 1/4 of their students cheated, but that in itself says a lot about the school and the character of the teachers and students. 
  4. I can assume Thomas High Schools numbers of students in the 9th grade graduating class will significantly decrease as that is a violation of honor code so majority of the 9th grade class will most likely be expelled.
